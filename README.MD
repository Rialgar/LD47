This is my entry for LD 47. Evade the red obstacles and collect the golden coins.

I purposefully kept this one really small in scope, since I did not feel like actually investing the entire weekend. I am pretty happy with how it turned out, I am getting pretty good at estimating how much I can do on a LD Weekend.

This game is fully implemented using html5 + javascript. Any modern browser should be able to run it, but I only tested in Google Chrome.
